learning a file to remove
i deleted or removed in gitbash 
but my question is will it push changes to git(for this added text)
answer is no .if you give git add git commit and git push then only it takes recent changes and save to git
if you removed then changes not saved to git 
05-file name 05-delete
i created to delete but when i gave command git rm -rf 05-delete 
it directly deleted from vs code but git showing that file num 05-delete in git website
